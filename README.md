Result:
Summary of Experiment Results: In this experiment, various AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity) were evaluated on their performance, user experience, and response quality across multiple prompting types (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-thought, Role-based, ReAct, Instruction-following, and Context-enriched). The task involved evaluating their ability to answer technical questions related to soft robotics in mechanical engineering, specifically how soft robotics innovations can aid in reducing recovery time in surgical applications. Key Findings:

ChatGPT: o Overall Winner: Consistently provided the most detailed, coherent, and accurate responses across all prompt types. ChatGPT demonstrated the highest level of flexibility in adapting to different question formats and providing insightful answers with adequate technical depth. o Best Performance: In Chain-of-thought, Context-enriched, and Instruction-following prompts, where clear and structured responses were necessary.
Claude: o Second Best: Claude performed well, especially in Instruction-following and Context-enriched prompts, but lacked the depth and coherence of ChatGPT in some complex technical questions. In cases where more detailed analysis was required, Claude occasionally provided answers with less specific examples or a less clear connection to the question at hand. o Strength: Its ability to provide structured responses but with occasional shortcomings in deeper explanations.
Perplexity: o Third Place: Perplexity often delivered adequate responses but showed inconsistent performance, especially in detailed technical discussions. It sometimes failed to provide responses that were both coherent and relevant to the question's core, especially in context-rich or role-based prompts. o Limitations: The responses from Perplexity lacked in-depth technical reasoning and often missed out on connecting key points that were necessary for a complete answer.

Overall Observations:
‚Ä¢ ChatGPT demonstrated the best overall consistency in both technical depth and clarity, making it the ideal model for handling complex, technical topics like soft robotics.

‚Ä¢ Claude provided competent responses, though sometimes falling short of ChatGPT in depth, especially for technical topics that required a more nuanced understanding of engineering concepts.

‚Ä¢ Perplexity, while offering helpful answers, struggled the most with complexity and coherence, making it less suitable for tasks that require high-level technical reasoning or detailed explanations.

Conclusion:
The experiment successfully illustrated the comparative strengths and weaknesses of different AI models when responding to prompts of varying complexity. ChatGPT stood out as the top performer, followed by Claude, with Perplexity lagging behind in technical tasks. The findings underscore the importance of choosing the right AI model based on the type of question and the level of technical complexity involved.
